-------
- Use `GitHub code scanning (CodeQL)
  <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-with-codeql>`_
  for integrity check as `it replaces LGTM
  <https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/>`_
- Added a centroid/center of mass functionality to analyse peak position of a spectrum (both in `utils`` and in `LumiSpectrum``)
- Add documentation of signal tools

Maintenance

.. _changes_0.2.1:

2022-11-02 - version 0.2.1
==========================
Added
-----
- Improved documentation
- Use lgtm.com to check code integrity

Changed
-------
- Fix conversion to Raman shift (relative wavenumber) and make ``jacobian=False`` default; ``fix inplace=False`` for axis conversions
- Fix ``to_eV`` and ``to_invcm``, as slicing with `.isig[]` was failing on converted signals
- ``s.remove_negative`` now defaults to ``inplace=False`` (previously ``True``)

Maintenance
-----------

- Make ``LumiTransient`` 1D and add 2D ``LumiTransientSpectrum`` class
- Add python 3.10 build, remove python 3.6
- Fix error in background dimensions that allows compatibility for updated ``map`` in HyperSpy (failing integration tests)
- Fix for links in PyPi
- Deprecate ``exposure`` argument of ``s.scale_by_exposure`` in favor of ``integration_time`` in line with metadata convention
- Add deprecation warning to ``remove_background_from_file``
