Implement correct casting of :class:`~.signals.luminescence_transientspec.LumiTransientSpectrum` to either :class:`~.signals.luminescence_spectrum.LumiSpectrum` or :class:`~.signals.luminescence_transient.LumiTransient` when the signal dimension is reduced - previously, a :class:`~hyperspy.api.signals.Signal1D` object was returned.
