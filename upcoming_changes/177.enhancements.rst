`crop_edges` moved to utils to allow consistent cropping for a list of signals. It also now
can take 1,2 or 4 values as input (can crop each axis independently) and accepts HyperSpy fancy indexing.
It can still be used for a single signal through the :class:`CommonLumi` class, but using
the parameter ``crop_px`` will be deprecated in the future.
